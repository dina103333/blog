    Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].

    Examples:


    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [3,4,5]
    Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    Output: [4,5,6]
    Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

        // Move mid pointer one step forward
        mid = mid.next
        // Move first pointer two steps forward
        first = first.next.next
    
    // When first pointer reaches the end of the list, mid pointer will be at the middle node
    // If the length of the list is odd, mid pointer will be at the first middle node
